# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This project demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. The project includes source code, example datasets, and a detailed report explaining the methodology and results.

Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It transforms the data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variances come to lie on the first coordinates (called principal components), the second greatest variances on the second coordinates, and so on. This project aims to demonstrate how PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.

Features
Implementation of PCA algorithm
Customizable number of principal components
Example datasets for experimentation
Visualization of principal components and explained variance
Detailed report explaining the methodology and findings
Installation
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/principal-component-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd principal-component-analysis
Install the necessary dependencies (assuming the use of Python and pip):
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Code
The source code for the PCA algorithm is provided in the main.py file. To run the code and perform PCA on the example dataset, execute the following command:

sh
Copy code
python main.py
Example Data
The example datasets are provided in the data directory. You can modify the datasets or use your own data by replacing the files in this directory.

Visualization
The program will generate plots to visualize the principal components and the explained variance ratio. These plots will be saved in the output directory.

Report
A detailed report explaining the PCA algorithm, the dataset, the transformation process, and the results obtained is provided in the report.docx file. Open the report using any compatible word processor.
